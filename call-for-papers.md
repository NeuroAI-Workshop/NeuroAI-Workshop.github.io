<!-- # Call for Papers -->

We invite the researchers in the field of NeuroAI to submit their papers to the this Workshop. Authors are encouraged to submit their NeurIPS main conference submissions concurrently to this workshop.

Submissions should adhere to a page limit of 5 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials) and must use the [NeurIPS 2024 LaTeX template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip). 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Neuro-inspired Computations
- Explainable AI in Neuroscience
- Self-supervised Systems in NeuroAI

We strongly discourage the presentation of already completed machine learning work including those pfreviously published in NeurIPS main track conference, as our focus is on showcasing innovative and ongoing research. 

Please note submissions that solely explore ML/AI algorithms without an explicit link to neuroscience are out of scope.

**Submission Deadline:** September 7, 2024  
**Notification of Acceptance:** October 14, 2024

Submit your papers through our [submission portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/NeuroAI#tab-your-consoles).
