<!-- # Call for Papers -->

We invite the researchers in the field of NeuroAI to submit their papers to the this Workshop. Authors are also encouraged to submit short versions of their NeurIPS main conference submissions concurrently to this workshop.

Submissions should adhere to a page limit of 5 pages (excluding references and supplementary materials) and must use the [NeurIPS 2024 LaTeX template](https://media.neurips.cc/Conferences/NeurIPS2024/Styles.zip). 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:


- Explainable and interpretable AI in neuroscience
- Self-supervised systems in NeuroAI
- Neuro-inspired architectures, and computations
- Neuronally-plausible learning regimes 
- Neuro-inspired reasoning and decision-making
- Cognitive functions in AI

The topics above are NOT exhaustive, and we encourage the submission of research related to how principles and insights from neuroscience can lead to better artificial intelligence and vice versa.  Our aim is to foster groundbreaking interdisciplinary research that advances both fields.

We strongly discourage the presentation of already completed and/or published machine learning work including those published in previous NeurIPS main track conferences, as our focus is on showcasing innovative and ongoing research. 

Please note submissions that solely explore ML/AI algorithms without an explicit link to neuroscience are out of scope.

**Submission Deadline:** September 7, 2024  
**Notification of Acceptance:** October 9, 2024

Submit your papers through our [submission portal](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2024/Workshop/NeuroAI#tab-your-consoles).
