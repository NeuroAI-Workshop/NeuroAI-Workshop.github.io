<!-- # Overview -->

Welcome to the NeuroAI Workshop! This workshop aims to bring together researchers and practitioners from the fields of neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

This workshop aims to explore the forefront of NeuroAI, a growing field that converges the domains of artificial and real intelligence. Focusing on the innovative intersections between Brain-Inspired Algorithms, Explainable AI in Neuroscience, Neurosymbolic Systems, and Synthetic Biological Intelligence, the workshop provides a platform for researchers and experts to navigate the intricate relationships between artificial intelligence and the complexities of the human brain.

Delving deeper into this interdisciplinary landscape, we seek to evaluate progress toward a unified mathematical model of the brain and investigate the potential for artificial intelligence to transcend it. Through rigorous examination of current research trajectories in neuroscience and AI, we seek to identify fundamental gaps and challenges, thereby paving the way for novel insights and future directions.

The key topics will include:

- **Brain-Inspired Algorithms:** Showcasing the latest advancements in algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain. Exploring how brain-inspired algorithms, such as spiking neural networks, can enhance the capabilities and efficiency of artificial systems. This can include exploring cutting-edge approaches that leverage insights from neuroscience to enhance transfer learning in artificial intelligence models. Discussing applications where knowledge from the brain can be transferred to improve the efficiency of AI algorithms across diverse tasks.

- **Explainable AI in Neuroscience:** Unpacking the integration of AI models with neuroscientific principles to enhance interpretability and explainability. Discussing the potential of explainable AI to deepen our understanding of neural processes and decision-making mechanisms.

- **Neurosymbolic Systems:** Investigating the synergy between symbolic reasoning and neural networks in the development of neurosymbolic systems. Examining how neurosymbolic approaches can address challenges in AI related to reasoning, knowledge representation, and understanding complex data.

- **Synthetic Biological Intelligence:** Investigating emerging paradigms in synthetic biological intelligence, including the integration of biological live neurons and their learning mechanisms into artificial systems. Exploring the potential for harnessing biological principles to advance understanding of human brain learning and the development of intelligent systems and redefine the boundaries of artificial and real intelligence.
